Add the AI Navigation package through Unity's Package Manager.

In Package Manager, select **AI Navigation**.
Expand **Samples** and import **NavMesh Components 2D** (or similarly named).
The import creates a folder under `Assets/Samples/AI Navigation/â€¦` containing `NavMeshBuilder2D` and related scripts.
`NavMeshBuilder2D` and `NavMeshSurface2D` will then appear in the Add Component menu.
