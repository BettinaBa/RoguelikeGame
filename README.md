# Roguelike Game

This project uses Unity's **AI Navigation** package for pathfinding. If your Unity installation doesn't include the NavMesh system, open the **Package Manager** and add the **AI Navigation** package (`com.unity.ai.navigation`).

After installing the package, the NavMesh surfaces can be baked through the `NavMeshBuilder2D` component in the scene.
